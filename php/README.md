# PHP Backend Challenge

The first step to run the application is get the dependencies running the following command:

```bash
>php composer.phar install
```

You can execute the example code with the following command:

```bash
>php src/challenge/Challenge.php
```

Note that no output is expected.

Run the tests with that command:

```bash
./bin/phpunit test
```
